#  RealMouse

#### This program is designed to fix some of the infuriating shortcomings of the mouse in MacOS, allowing you to use a real mouse

## Features
- \[Untested\] Run at login
- \[Untested\] Reverse mouse scroll direction: In MacOS the scrolling direction of the trackpad and the mouse are connected for some reason. This reverses the scroll direction of the mouse compared to the trackpad setting.
- \[Untested\] Enable forward and back mouse buttons: There are often buttons on the side of a mouse. These do not do anything by default in MacOS. This changes that.
- \[Untested\] Adjust/disable mouse acceleration
- \[Untested\] Disable scrolling acceleration: This is an easier way to disable scrolling acceleration on Mac for only the mouse wheel.
- \[Implemented\] Swap mouse buttons

## TODO
- Tweak error reporting and crashing
